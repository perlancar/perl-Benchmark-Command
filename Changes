	[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Replace option 'debug' with 'quiet' and reverse the default behavior.
          Previously it was all too easy to lose program's output. If the
          command was erroneous, prints an error message, and exits early, this
          can ruin the benchmark result. Previously this was not displayed by
          default because by default program's output is stripped. Now the
          default behavior is to *not* strip program's output, unless the
          'quiet' option is set to true.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add option: ignore_exit_code. Now a non-zero exit code will cause the
          benchmark to die, unless we set this option to true.

        - Add per-command options: ignore_exit_code, skip_not_found.

        - Tweak examples and other minor fixes.


0.04    2015-04-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add option: debug; by default strip programs' output unless in

        - Allow specifying coderef command, which will be used as-is.
